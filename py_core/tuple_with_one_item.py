#Creating a tuple with one item - to create a tuple with one item, you need to add a comma at the end of the tuple otherwise python won't treat it as tuple
#correct way
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(thistuple)
print(type(thistuple))

#wrong way
not_tuple = ("apple")
print(not_tuple)
print(type(not_tuple))

#end
