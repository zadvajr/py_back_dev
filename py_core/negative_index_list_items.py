#Access list items with negative index
# if you access list item with a negative index, it will start from the end of the list
# this trick can be used to access the last list item as follows

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Orange"] #list

#to access last element 
print(fruits[-1]) #prints: Orange

#to access second to last element
print(fruits[-2])

#end
