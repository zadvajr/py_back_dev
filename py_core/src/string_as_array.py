#Python - string as array
#in python string is treated as character array.
# there is no data type for a character, it is simple a string of length 1

full_name = "Daniel Zadva Jnr"
initial = full_name[0] + full_name[7] + full_name[13] #assess string full_name at some index 0,7 and 13

print("My Full Name is: ", full_name)
print("And my Initial is: ", initial)


#NOTE: you can assess characters in a string with index just as in array
#end
