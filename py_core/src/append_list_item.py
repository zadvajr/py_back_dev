#append list item - to add an item to the end of the list  use append() method as follows

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"]

print("Before appending: ", fruits)

fruits.append("Cherry") # appends "Cheery" to the end of the list

#you can also append more than one items at a time
fruits.append("Orange", "Melon", "Kiwi", "Mango")
